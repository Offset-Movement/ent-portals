# Portals of EntDAO


A Decentralized Autonomous Organicity of people, and the other livings, starting with animals and plants in urban areas.

People will be gaininng power of representation/delegation, through their support, care, stewardship activities around wellbeing of those livings. 

Hence, altogether, realize [liquid democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_democracy), a continuous, revokable, direct decision-making experience in energy consumption target-making: Locally and globally, while reflecting nature positively and constantly via real-time data and scientific rulesets empowering other livings on having a voice on offset decision makings.

Peope are of course, will be using their own vote with their free will, however, other livings will have a substantial weight here on climate-positive resolutions, as well as them, rewarding people that care, with their identities, wallets, accounts on blockchain.

Giving voice to nature, is not all about an inclusion in decision-making. It's also, that those portals are where we'll be observing the story of that neighbourhoods' activities in time, on the are-taking; while we'll be generating artworks through all those data and interactions.

When the app is opened, zoom-out a little and see the trees, and click one to see a card nearby, ready to tell stories through.. 

(as-is, that's all we got. to be continued ...)

## Background

Back in 5-6 February, co-imagined and developed during [Sovereign Nature Initiative's (northern) Winter 2022 Hackathon](https://sovereignnature.com/winter-2022-hackathon-challenge)

Project treats all livings as assets, rather than resources. 

[Trees as Infrastructure](https://treesasinfrastructure.com) project is somehow resonating with our approach and feelings, and we've been inspired by the research they've been through.

Here, in fact we wanted to give a voice to nature through the actions-history of the stewards, and what decisions made together for local, energy consumption targets making. 

Here's how we have co-imagined that:

Trees in fact become portals to such stories, and means of connection and be socio-economic and democratic catalyzers and mind shifters via their empowerment on following scientific rulesets on those decision-making of their beloved stewards.
