# Portals of EntDAO

Decentralized Autonomous Organicity 

Of all livings, starting with those livings in urban scenes.

All participants registered there will have a crypto wallet, account(s) and a decentralized id/ DID.

Among those, people will get to represent the others as they care, steward and support the wellbeing of those identified and registered plants and animals.

Back in 5-6 February, co-imagined and developed during [Sovereign Nature Initiative's (northern) Winter 2022 Hackathon](https://sovereignnature.com/winter-2022-hackathon-challenge)

Project treats all livings as assets, rather than resources. 

Here, in fact we wanted to give a voice to nature through the actions-history of the stewards, and what decisions made together for local, energy consumption targets making. 

Trees in fact becoming portals to such stories, and means of connection and be socio-economic and democratic catalyzers and mind shifters via their empowerment on following scientific rulesets on those decision-making of their beloved stewards.
